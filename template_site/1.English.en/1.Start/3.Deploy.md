# Deploy

With Comet, publishing your site is also easy.

1. Let's start by creating a dedicated repository on GitHub.

[New Repository](https://github.com/new)

<br />

2. Next, write your GitHub **UserID** and the created **RepositoryName** in `my_site/comet.yaml` .

```comet.yaml
...
github
  user_id: YourUserID
  repository_name: YourRepositoryName
```

<br />

3. Run commands inside `my_site` .

```
$ comet deploy
```

<br />

4. Please respond if a security check is conducted.

If asked for your UserID, enter your UserID.
If asked for a Password, enter your AccessToken.

<br />

That's all done!
