:::

- Choose fonts

```
fonts:
  - url: "/jp/"
    font: FontNameJP
  - url: "/en/"
    font: FontNameEN
```

- if the URL contains `url`, Comet uses the `font` a font-family name.
- Put your font file into Flutter project according to Flutter rules.

ignore_folders:

- don't use the path format like `Folder1/Folder2..`. only folder names are available.
